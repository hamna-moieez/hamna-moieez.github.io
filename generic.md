      <h3> Slum Mapping Via Remote Sensing Imagery </h3>
      <p align="justify"><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/pic14.png %}" alt="" /></span><b><em> Jun 2019 - present </em></b><a href="https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/">TUKL-NUST</a> is a research and development center set up by a joint collaboration of TUKL,Germany, and NUST, Islamabad advised by Prof. Dr. Faisal Shafait. I am working on undergraduate research thesis with TUKL-NUST R&D Center on slum mapping and localization using satellite imagery.I am focusing on identifying slums and collecting datasets from satellite imagery in Karachi and Islamabad. My current focus is on building loss functions to characterize long-tailed distributions since in majority of slum datasets the foreground pixels are dominant. This work is being done in collaboration with SiPEO Lab at TUM, Germany and German Aerospace Center. </p>

    <h3>Whalify</h3>
    <p align="justify"> A project for classification and detection of whale calls without any speech pre-processing involved. For this, I collected raw audio dataset from Kaggle and CMST. The goal was to perform binary classification on orca and other whale call types. I trained AlexNet for thetask by converting raw audio samples to spectrograms.</p>

    <h3>Distracted Driver Detection</h3>
    <p align="justify">An image classiﬁcation task using a Kaggle dataset for the StateFarm Competition. I built a simpliﬁed VGG net for the multi-class classiﬁcation task at hand for the task and then tested the performance of the model on the provided dataset achieving compareable results.</p>
